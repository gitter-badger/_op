***We believe contributors should be*** [financially rewarded](TODO) ***for their hard work***.  Don't be afraid to learn how because you'll be paid - Like it or not!

**To become a `member`** of any of our (codePile.PBC) projects, follow one of the following links that suits your flavor:  

>** Either if you are a developer, designer or the end-user**, it is advisable to read the [user docs](https://oceanpress.readme.io/docs/getting-started-with-oceanpress) to get familiar with the application before diving into writing any code.

 - **The Place for Developers** working with (or contributing to) the OceanPress project would be found in the ["Getting Started as a Developer"](https://oceanpress.readme.io/docs/getting-started-as-a-developer) chapter. **Otherwise**, you know what you are doing (and we will give you all kinds of love), log into your GitHub account and pull something from our back log at [waffle.io](https://waffle.io/oceanpress/OceanPress).

 - **Documentation for Themers** can be found in the themers section, ["Getting Started as a Themer](https://oceanpress.readme.io/docs/getting-started-as-a-themer). Check it out because we made it super easy-peasy to create fresh and current themes for OceanPress!

 - **Plz Keep in mind** The Docs are rough drafts. (help me? Gulp!) Work there is still in progress - mostlikly it will always will be. Some pages are only outlines and there are many other topics left to go where no man has gone before. If you would like to go an a adventure and help out with the documentation, beam on over to [oceanpress.readme.io]() and click on the "Suggest Edits" in the upper right-hand corner of the document.

 > **NOTE:** ***If this is your first time hearing about OceanPress and/or codePile***, *We strongly recommend starting with the [website](http://oceanpress.io) to learn about what OceanPress is and why it's conception came about. Farther reading about the developing organization, [codePile.PBC](http://codepile.org), is also recommended. Both these sites will help you (the developer/contributor) understand the concepts and philosophies within the OceanPress and codePile brands and the public benefit organization behind it.*
